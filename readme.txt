This is a ready to use source code of WebRTC video conference built in this course. To run the app, make sure:
- Delete 'secure: true,' code line inside 'webrtc-controller.js' file.
- Change port value to '8080' (also inside webrtc-controller.js) in order for the app can be accessed using 'localhost:8080'.
- Open Command Prompt program which point to this folder (C:\...\video-conference>), then with internet connected, run 'npm install' command in the Command Prompt.
- Next, run 'nodemon server.js' command in the Command Prompt.
- Run app by opening browser and enter 'localhost:8080' inside address bar.
